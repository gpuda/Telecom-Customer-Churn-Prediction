LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Problem Statement : "You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers" 
The main types of attributes are : 
1.Demographics (age, gender etc.) 
2.Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers etc) 
3.Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.) 

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not. 
So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. 
It is a binary variable 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned. 
With 21 predictor variables we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not.

DATA PROCEDURE:
0. Import the required libraries 
1. Importing all datasets 
2. Merging all datasets based on condition ("customer_id ") 
3. Data Cleaning - checking the null values 
4. Check for the missing values and replace them 
5. Model building • Binary encoding • One hot encoding • Creating dummy variables and removing the extra columns

Feature selection using RFE - Recursive Feature Elimination
Getting the predicted values on train set
Creating a new column predicted with 1 if churn > 0.5 else 0
Create a confusion matrix on train set and test
Check the overall accuracy
